## RTEMS 5.1 Release Notes

### RTEMS Improvements

In this section, we discuss public API level changes as well as improvements to
the implementation of those API routines.

Public API changes usually fall into one of the following categories:

* Addition of new methods

## RTEMS Shell Improvements

The following improvements were made to the RTEMS Shell:

* Telnet now supports `joel` script output. Running a `joel` script in a
  telnet session now sees the output. Nested `joel` scripts also output to the
  telnet session.

## General

* The system initialization is now performed by system initialization handlers
  registered in a special linker set (similar to global constructors in C++).

* API header files have been collected from the various locations in the RTEMS
  source tree and placed under `cputkit/include` and for BSPs under
  `bsps/include`. There is no header pre-install phase when building RTEMS.

* Improved parallel build performance. Nested `make` calls now run in
  parallel.

* Added support for the RISC-V 32-bit and 64-bit architecture.

* Added support for the 64-bit PowerPC architecture using the ELFv2 ABI.

* Synchronized support for Journalling Flash File System, Version 2 (JFFS2)
  with Linux 4.17.

* Import of libfdt from device tree compiler project.

* Added `libdebugger`, a thread aware GDB debug server with TCP transport
  support. Currently the supported architectures are i386 and ARM. The ARM
  support is experimental.

* Most BSP use now function and data sections to support the linker garbage
  collection.

* This is the last release of RTEMS with the `autoconf`/`automake` build
  system. RTEMS will be moving to a `waf` based build system driven from YAML
  specifications files. The effort is part of the on-going wotk in the RTEMS
  project to support qualification of the operating system.
