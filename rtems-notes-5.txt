## RTEMS Shell Improvements

The following improvements were made to the RTEMS Shell:

* Telnet now supports `joel` script output. Running a `joel` script in a
  telnet session now sees the output. Nested `joel` scripts also output to the
  telnet session.

## General

* The system initialization is now performed by system initialization handlers
  registered in a special linker set (similar to global constructors in C++).

* API header files have been collected from the various locations in the RTEMS
  source tree and placed under `cputkit/include` and for BSPs under
  `bsps/include`. There is no header pre-install phase when building RTEMS.

* Improved parallel build performance. Nested `make` calls now run in
  parallel.

* Added support for the RISC-V 32-bit and 64-bit architecture.

* Added support for the 64-bit PowerPC architecture using the ELFv2 ABI.

* Synchronized support for Journalling Flash File System, Version 2 (JFFS2)
  with Linux 4.17.

* Import of libfdt from device tree compiler project.

* Added `libdebugger`, a thread aware GDB debug server with TCP transport
  support. Currently the supported architectures are i386 and ARM. The ARM
  support is experimental.

* Most BSP use now function and data sections to support the linker garbage
  collection.

* This is the last release of RTEMS with the `autoconf`/`automake` build
  system. RTEMS will be moving to a `waf` based build system driven from YAML
  specifications files. The effort is part of the on-going wotk in the RTEMS
  project to support qualification of the operating system.
