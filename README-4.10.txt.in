Quick Guide to Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the tools and kernel for an architecture download:

  rtems-source-builder-@RELEASE@.tar.xz

Please check to the RSB documentation (https://docs.rtems.org/rsb/) and the
Wiki (TBD) if you have any issues.

If you encounter a problem please post to the user@rtems.org mailing list and
if you find a bug please raise a ticket (https://devel.rtems.org/newticket).

The following builds RTEMS for the SPARC architecture:

 $ cd
 $ mkdir development/rtems
 $ cd development/rtems
 $ tar Jxf /path/to/rtems-source-builder-@RELEASE@.tar.xz
 $ cd rtems-source-builder-@RELEASE@/rtems
 $ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder \
         --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/@RELEASE@ \
	 @VERSION@/rtems-sparc

To disable building the RTEMS Kernel add to the command line '--without-rtems'.

To build a single BSP add to the command line '--with-rtemsbsp'. You can
specify more than one BSP with quotes and a space delimiting the BSP names. By
default all BSPs for an architecture are built.
